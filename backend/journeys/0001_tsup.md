# tsup

## What is Tsup?

tsup is a build tool for TypeScript. It is a drop-in replacement for TSC.

## Why Tsup?

Purely for support for relative imports. I couldn't get this to work with vanilla tsc + node. Upon asking Cursor to resolve this, it set up tsup. 

I'm not sure I'll keep it because I've not looked into it much at all, but for now it makes using relative imports easier, which in turn are easier to work with.
